## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

## Troubleshooting

### Windows Setup Guide
1. Install WSL2:
   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```
   After installation, restart your computer.

2. Configure Docker Desktop:
   - Install Docker Desktop for Windows
   - Open Docker Desktop Settings
   - Navigate to 'Resources' > 'WSL Integration'
   - Enable 'Use WSL 2 based engine'
   - Enable integration with your Linux distro
   - Click 'Apply & Restart'

3. Verify Setup:
   ```powershell
   # Check WSL version
   wsl -l -v
   # Should show "VERSION 2" for your distro

   # Verify Docker in WSL
   wsl docker --version
   ```

4. Configure VSCode:
   - Install 'Remote - WSL' extension
   - Open your Laravel project in WSL
   - Make sure Docker Desktop is running

### Common Issues and Solutions
- If containers aren't showing up, check if Docker is running
- For permission issues, ensure proper Docker configuration
